    "**Proposal 1:**\n",
    "- Do students perform worse academically when they play video games frequently?\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables:\n",
    "- Video Game Time (Continuous Variable): How many hours spent playing video games.\n",
    "  - Visualization: Scatter plot to show the relationship between playing video games and exam results. This would show any trends or correlations.\n",
    "- Exam Scores (Continuous variable): The scores received on the exam.\n",
    "  - Visualization: Histogram to display the distribution of all exam scores, showing overall performance of all students.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis:\n",
    "- A linear regression analysis will be used to see the relationship between playing video games and exam scores. The assumptions for linear regression include normal distribution, homoscedasticity, linearity, and independence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis:\n",
    "- Null Hypothesis: There is no significant relationship between playing video games and exam scores\n",
    "- Alternative Hypothesis: There is a significant negative relationship between playing video games and exam scores\n",
    "- If the results show that the p-value < 0.05 then it would suggest that playing video games negatively affects academic performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proposal 2:**\n",
    "- Do STEM students have more work than business students?\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables:\n",
    "- Field of Study (Categorical Variable): STEM and business students\n",
    "  - Visualization: Bar chart to compare average hours worked by each group\n",
    "- Hours Worked (Continuous Variable): Total number of hours worked on assignments, projects, and studying.\n",
    "  - Visualization: Box plot to display the distribution of hours worked for both groups. Showing difference in workloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis: \n",
    "- We will use linear regression where hours worked per week is the dependent variable, and the student group (STEM or Business) is the independent variable. The assumptions for linear regression include normal distribution, homoscedasticity, linearity, and independence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis:\n",
    "- Null Hypothesis: There is a significant difference in workload between STEM students and Business students.\n",
    "- Alternative Hypothesis: STEM students have a greater workload than business students.\n",
    "- If the results show that the p-value < 0.05 then it would suggest that STEM students have a greater workload.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proposal 3:**\n",
    "- Do students prefer blackboards or projectors for instructional purposes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables:\n",
    "- Teaching Tool Preference (Categorical Variable): Blackboard and projector\n",
    "  - Visualization: Pie chart or Bar chart to show the percentage of students preferring each tool\n",
    " \n",
    " Analysis:\n",
    " - Descriptive Statistics: Find the total number of responses for each tool, and calculate the percentages. We need independence for this to work, therefore going to many different universities and schools would help.\n",
    " \n",
    " Hypothesis:\n",
    " - Null Hypothesis: There is no preference among students for blackboards or projectors, Blackboard Students = Projector Students\n",
    " - Alternative Hypothesis: There is a preference among students for blackboards or projectors, Blackboard Students <span>&#8800;</span>\n",
    " Projector Students"
